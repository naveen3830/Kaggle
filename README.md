# Kaggle Projects Repository

This repository, named "kaggle," is dedicated to storing all my Kaggle projects. Kaggle is a platform that provides a collaborative environment for data science and machine learning competitions, as well as a rich resource for datasets and kernels.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized to maintain a clean and structured layout for each Kaggle project. Here's an overview of the main folders:

- **billionaires-data-visualization.ipynb(/):**
  - Overview: Brief description of the project.
  - Dataset: Storage for dataset files.
  - Notebooks: Jupyter notebooks capturing the data exploration, analysis, and modeling.
  - Results: Output files, visualizations, and model weights.
  - README: Project-specific information, instructions, and insights.

Feel free to explore each project's folder to find detailed information and code for each Kaggle competition or dataset analysis.
